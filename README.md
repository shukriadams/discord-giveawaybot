# discord-giveawaybot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shukriadams/discord-giveawaybot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shukriadams/discord-giveawaybot)

A Discord bot that manages automated game giveaways on Discord channels. Built-in integration for Steam titles, but can
give anything connected to a URL away. Heavily inspired by https://github.com/jagrosh/GiveawayBot, differs from the
original with :

- bot commands are in private message, allowing for surprise giveaways, direct messaging of game keys to winners,
  detailed data queries and other quiet admin functions
- queuing of future giveaways
- anti-greed features automatically prevents a winner from entering another giveaway for a while
- better Steam integration

A demo version can be seen on Discord: https://discord.gg/gMEGQBj (Bot is limited to non-admin functions, I can't
auto-assign admin rights to users. I'm not active on this Discord channel, its for demo purposes, if you need help or
found a bug use Github.

## Requirements

- NodeJS 7 or greater.

## Create your bot on Discord first

- go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me
- click on "new app"
- follow the instructions and create your app, normally you need to add only a name
- after creating your app, click on "create a bot user", this converts your app to a bot (a good thing)
- on the bot's config page, click on "click to reveal token", copy this, and keep it handy for the next step

## Host your bot

There are three ways to host your bot. Regardless of which you use, you need to create a work folder where all volatile
files are kept, and a settings file inside that folder.

    # bot root folder. package.json etc lives here if you're not using the Docker solution
    mkdir myBot

    # bot work folder
    mkdir myBot/discord-giveawaybot

    # bot settings file
    touch myBot/discord-giveawaybot/settings.json

In the root of this Github project you'll find exampleSettings.json, copy its contents to your settings file, and
replace "ADD YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE" with your own Discord bot token (see "Create your bot on Discord first" step above).

### 1) From Docker image

Image on Docker hub : https://hub.docker.com/r/shukriadams/discord-giveawaybot/

- Create a docker-compose.yml file in your bot root folder

        version: "2"
        services:
          node:
            container_name: discordgiveawaybot
            image: shukriadams/discord-giveawaybot:latest
            restart: unless-stopped
            command: npm start
            volumes:
            - ./discord-giveawaybot/:/usr/giveawaybot/discord-giveawaybot/:rw

- Run 

        docker-compose up -d

These settings can of course be tweaked to suite your host setup, only npm start and the volume map are required. All
volatile content is in the discord-giveawaybot folder, back this up if desired, your containers are disposable.

### 2) From NPM

- Install

        npm install discord-giveawaybot --save
    
- Run

        let Bot = require('discord-giveawaybot'),
            bot = new Bot();

        bot.start();

### 3) From source

- Clone this repo.
- Run
    
        npm install
        npm start

## Add your bot to your Discord server

- back on your app's Discord config page (from the first section above), copy your bot's client id and paste it into
  this url, replacing YOURCLIENTID :

      https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=YOURCLIENTID&scope=bot&permissions=0

- then navigate to that url in a browser. You'll get the option to add it to your Discord server. After doing this you
should see your bot as a user on your server.
- Your bot needs to know which channel you'll be broadcasting giveaways in. Go to the channel you want to use and write
"@BOTNAME channel" where BOTNAME is whatever name you gave your bot.
- That's it, you're set to go.

## Known issues

The bot can handle a maximum of 100 participants per giveaway. Anyone above that 100 will be ignored - this is a
limitation in Discord's API, and will be fixed when Discord fixes their API. As a workaround, a giveaway will
automatically end when it has reached 100 participants. 

## Additional config

By default, only admins can create and manage giveaways. If you want to delegate giveaway responsibilities to non-admins

- go to your Discord server settings and select "roles"
- on the roles page, add a role called "Giveaways". If you don't want to use this name, create any role you want, and
add that name to settings.json (requires bot restart)
- Assign the role "Giveaways" (or whatever you called it) to users who'll run giveaways.

## Commands

One of the major differences between this bot and jagrosh's giveawaybot is that this bot uses direct communication -
you don't talk to it in public chat.

### brackets

Price brackets let you limit how often users can win a game within a price range. If you register a bracket of $0-100,
and a user wins a game that costs $50, that user will automatically be prevented, for seven days, from entering another
giveaway for any game costing between 0 and 100 USD. Brackets are optional - you can register none, one, or as many as
you like.

    brackets 0-20-50-100

sets 3 brackets, 1-20, 20-50 and 50-100. If a game costs 20 USD, it falls in the first bracket that it fits in, 0-20 in
this case. You can start and brackets at any price range. For example

    brackets -b 20-30

sets one bracket, and will catch only games that fall in its range, and a user will be allowed unlimited entry in games
below 20USD or above 30USD.

Prices are always in USD.

For a list of current brackets, use

    brackets

### cancel

Admins or the creator of a giveaway can cancel that giveaway if it hasn't started yet, or is in progress.

### channel

This is the only bot command done in public chat. It registers the channel from which it is sent as the channel in which
giveaways will be broadcast.

### help

Gets a list of commands from the bot.

### list

Lists all ongoing giveaways.

    list all

Shows ongoing and complete and cancelled giveaways.

Additionally, admins and users with giveaway rolls will be able to see pending giveaways.

### me

Tell a user if they're on cooldown for a given bracket if they recently won a game in that bracket.

### queue

Creates a giveaway to be started at some time in the future. Requires admin or giveaway roll. A game activation code
can optionally be added to this command - the winner will receive this code in a private message.

### reroll

An admin or user with giveaway role can reroll a winner on a finished giveaway if they so wish. Note this obviously
doesn't have much meaning if the activation code is attached to the giveaway, as the previous winner will already have
received the code, so use common sense.

### rules

Simple rules text can be found using

    rules

To set rules text, admin pemission is required. Use

    rules Your text here ...

### start

Immediately starts a giveaway.

### status

This command is currently disabled.

## Other

The bot automatically cleans out completed/cancelled competitions after 14 days.

## Development

The bot is basically two processes

- a message handler that receives message instructions from Discord users and responds to them immediately.
- a daemon which ticks at an interval, and which carries out instructions that are not directly driven by incoming user
  messages

All other files are helpers for the above. Other stuff :

- Giveaway data is persisted with a local Loki.js store, in /discord-giveawaybot/__store
- Errors are logged out with Winston in /discord-giveawaybot/__logs
- The daemon uses node-cron for its timer.

If you use Vagrant, the included vagrant script will start an Ubuntu VM ready to run the bot (for development or
testing).

    cd /vagrant
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh

Then in the VM run

    yarn --no-bin-links (flag needed only if your host machine is Windows)
    node start (or npm start)

If you want to run the bot directly on your host system without yarn

    npm install
    node start (or npm start)

## Tests

    npm test

or if you want to test with a debugger (Webstorm, VSCode etc), point your debugger to /tests/test.js and

    cd /tests
    node test
